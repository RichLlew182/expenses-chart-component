## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- JSON
- Fetch API
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a bit of a refresh on some of the skills that I learned in the bootcamp, such as the fetch api. 

### Continued development

I think this could be improved using React as there is quite a bit of repetition in the html, whereas with React I could generate components based off the json file.
